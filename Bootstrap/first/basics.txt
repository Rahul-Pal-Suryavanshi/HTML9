Bootstrap is a component library. Basically libraries are two types, one is utility library, another one is component library.
To understand Bootstrap you have to know three things
 i. layout: bootstrap follows grid structure with 12 columns
 columns can be mentioned with col-length inside class row, you can also keep rows insider container(it will give margin-left and right) or container-fluid
 ii.colors: primary(blue),secondary(grey),success(green),danger(red),info(skyblue),warning(yellow),dark/black,light/white
 iii.breakpoint:
 normal without any breakpoint ----<576px
 sm ---------- >=576px
 md -----------> >=768px
 lg ---------   >=992px
 xl ---------  >1200px
 xxl -------   >1400px
