  how do we select html elements from dom in javascript?

  document.getElementsByClassName('classname') - select list of elements with that class name

  document.getElementById('id') - select the element with that id

  document.querySelector('query') - it selects first element based on CSS query
  document.querySelectorAll('query') - select all elements based on css query

you can manipulate element by 
  textContent: you can manipulate text inside any element by textContent
  innerText : you can also manipulate text inside any element of dom by innerText but innerText also considers CSS
  innerHTML : you can manipulate whole html by innerHTML
  value: you can select value inside an input tag by element.value
