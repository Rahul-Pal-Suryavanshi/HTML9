// loops will iterate until condition fails unlike decision making statements which executes once.
There are two kinds of loops
1. entry control loop: condition will be checked at the entrance of loop
eg: while, for
while: 
  initialization;
  while(condition)
  {
    //statements;
    updation;
  }

for loop: for loop will take initialization,condition,updation in the same line. that's why it s mostly used loop.

In js , we have several variations of for, some are
standard loop:
for(initialization;condition;updation)
{
    //statements
}












2. exit control loop:

do-while:
initialization;
do{
    //statements;
    updation
}while(condition);
