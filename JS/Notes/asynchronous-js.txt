Javascript is a synchronous , single threaded language
but we can also perform asynchronous logic
Asynchronous functions will take some time to execute

Timers: there are two timers available in browser's Web API. they are 
setTimeout(fn,time in milli seconds)
setInterval(fn,time in milli seconds)

Web API's : Web API's are functionalities given by browser to Javascript
eg: console,document,timers,fetch

API(Application Programming interface):
one application can interact with another application/ backend data through API's
There are different Types Of API'seconds
1.REST API's: These are used for Representation State Transfer CRUD Operations.
commonly used for Web Development. we will send data As JSON
2. SOAP API's:(simple Object Access Protocol): we will transfer the data as XML 
3.graphQL: used for faster request and will request only when it is needed
4.websockets: used fro real time messaging eg:chatting

How to get Data From API:
 we will get the data from API(REST API) using fetch. In olden times we used to use XmlHttpRequest. we can also use third party libraries like "axios"

 
fetch returns a promise. if promise is resolved it will goto then, if promise rejects , it will goto catch
